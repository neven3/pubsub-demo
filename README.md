# pubsub-demo
A demonstration of the publisher-subscriber pattern in a simple application.

I was asked about the pub-sub pattern once, didn't know anything about it at the time, so I wanted to learn a bit about it and what its implementation looks like in code.

I do not take credit for the project, it was made after learning about the pattern from a tutorial on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aynSM8llOBs).
I did, however, reproduce it from scratch and used class-based syntax.
